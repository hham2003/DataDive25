## What We Did

We looked at whether regulatory quality actually matters for jobs. Using the new B-READY indicators (51 economies) combined with Enterprise Survey data, we tested which regulations help reduce vulnerable employment and ease firm-level constraints.

---

## Main Finding

**Labor regulation quality is what matters.**

A 1-point improvement in labor regulation → 0.48 percentage point reduction in vulnerable employment (p = 0.028, R² = 74.3%).

Other regulatory dimensions (finance, trade, utilities) showed no significant effect once we controlled for GDP.

## The Surprise

Better business entry regulations actually *increase* labor constraints (+0.51, p = 0.001). More firms = more competition for workers = perceived shortages. Entry reforms need to be paired with skills development.

---

## Data

- B-READY Pillar I (2024) — 51 economies, 11 regulatory dimensions
- Enterprise Surveys — firm constraints, training rates
- ILO — vulnerable employment rates
- WDI — GDP per capita, trade openness

---

## Policy Takeaway

1. **Prioritize labor regulations** — worker protections, contract enforcement, dispute resolution
2. **Sequence entry reforms** — don't liberalize entry without investing in skills
3. **Growth still matters most** — regulations complement development, they don't replace it
